## Seed code - Boilerplate for step 1 - DataMunger Assignment(PLEASE CHANGE THIS README POST CLONNING - SAVE THE INSTRUCTIONS SEPERATELY)

### Problem Statement

String Parsing  (Query string)

a. Write a program to read the query string as input from the user and parse the given string into word

    Input : 	select * from Employee.csv  where  department  = ‘HR’ and salary>=3000

    Output: 	[select ,*, from, Employee.csv,  where,  department,  =, ‘HR’, and, salary,>=,3000]

    Note:  If the query contains group by, order by, having should also fetch

b. Write a program to extract only the parts of query

	i.  Get only base query from the query string. (without where condition)
		Example : select * from Employee.csv  

	ii. Get only where condition part from the query
		Example : department  = ‘HR’ and salary>=3000
		Note: where condition part should not contain group by, order by, having parts.

	iii. Parse the Where condition part based on to the operators
		1. `Relational Operators`
			a. Ex: if where condition is :   department  = ‘HR’ and salary>=3000
			b. The output should be
				i. Restriction - 1
					1. propertyName : department
					2. properyValue : HR
					3. condtionalOperator : = 
				ii. Restriction - 2
					1. propertyName : salary
					2. properyValue : 3000
					3. condtionalOperator : >=

		2. `Logical Operators`
			a. Ex: if where condition is : department='Dev'  or department='HR' and salary>=3000 
				i. Extract the logical operators in sequence and display/store in collection	
					Output : [or,and]

		3. `Order by Operators`
			a. Ex query : select  *  from emp order by salary
			b. The output should be
				i. Order by field :   salary
			c. Note:  ‘where’ may present in the query.


        4. `Group by Operators`
		    a. Ex Query : select * from emp group by department
		    b. The output should be
			    i. Group by field : department
		    Note: ‘where’ may present in the query.

	    5. `Aggregate functions`
		    a. Ex: Query: select max(sal), min(age),count(*) from emp
			    i. The output should be
				    1. Aggregate function - 1
					    a. Function name : max
					    b. Field name        : sal
				    2.  Aggregate function - 2
					    a. Function name : min
					    b. Field name        : age
				    3.  Aggregate function - 3
					    a. Function name : count
					    b. Field name : *
		Note:  Other parts like where clause, order by, group by may be present in the query.

### Expected solution

Displaying various `components/parts` of the query like `selected fields, conditional parts, aggregate fields, groupBy field, OrderBy field` 

### Following are the broad tasks:
- read the query from the user into queryString variable
- call the parseQuery method and pass the queryString variable as a parameter
- split the string into words by space character
- parse the queryString into words and display
- getting the baseQuery and display
- get and display the filename
- get and display the where conditions part(if where condition exists)
- parse the where conditions and display the propertyName, propertyValue and conditionalOperator for each conditions
- get the logical operators(applicable only if multiple conditions exist)
- get order by fields if order by clause exists
- get group by fields if group by clause exists
- parse and display aggregate functions(if applicable)

### Project structure

The folders and files you see in this repositories, is how it is expected to be in projects, which are submitted for automated evaluation by Hobbes

	Project
	|
	├── resources 			        // If project needs any data file, it can be found here/placed here, if data is huge they can be mounted, no need put it in your repository
	|
	├── com.stackroute.datamunger	    // all your java file will be stored in this package
	|	└── test		                // all your test cases are written using JUnit, these test cases can be run by selecting Run As -> JUnit Test 
	|	└── DataMunger.java	        // This is the main file, all your logic is written in this file only
	|
	├── .classpath			        // This file is generated automatically while creating the project in eclipse
	|
	├── .hobbes   			        // Hobbes specific config options, such as type of evaluation schema, type of tech stack etc., Have saved a default values for convenience
	|
	├── .project			            // This is automatically generated by eclipse, if this file is removed your eclipse will not recognize this as your eclipse project. 
	|
	├── pom.xml 			            // This is a default file generated by maven, if this file is removed your project will not get recognised in hobbes.
	|
	└── PROBLEM.md  		            // This files describes the problem of the assignment/project, you can provide as much as information and clarification you want about the project in this file

> PS: All lint rule files are by default copied during the evaluation process, however if need to be customizing, you should copy from this repo and modify in your project repo


#### To use this as a boilerplate for your new project, you can follow these steps

1. Clone the base boilerplate in your local

	`git clone https://gitlab-dev.stackroute.in/datamunger-java/step-1-boilerplate.git`

2. Remove its remote or original reference

	`git remote rm origin`

3. Add your new repository reference as remote

	`git remote add origin ssh://git@gitlab-dev.stackroute.in:2222/yourusername/your-new-project-repo.git`

4. Commit and Push the project to git

	`git commit -a -m "Initial commit | or place your comments according to your need"`

	`git push -u origin master`

5. Check on the git repo online, if the files have been pushed


### Important instructions for Participants
